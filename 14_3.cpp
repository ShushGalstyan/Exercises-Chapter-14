//(Print Array Range) Overload function template printArray of Fig. 14.1 so that it takes two additional integer arguments, namely int lowSubscript and int highSubscript . A call to this function will print only the designated portion of the array. Validate lowSubscript and highSubscript ; if either is out of range or if highSubscript is less than or equal to lowSubscript , the overloaded printArray function should return 0; otherwise, printArray should return the number of elements printed. Then modify main to exercise both versions of printArray on arrays a , b and c (lines 22â€“24 of Fig. 14.1). Be sure to test all capabilities of both versions of printArray .
